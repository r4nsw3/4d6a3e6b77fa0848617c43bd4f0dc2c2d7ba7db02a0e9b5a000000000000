  |   Save your family after a horrible accident with both a boomerang      |
  |   wrench and a clock that controls time.                                |
  |                                                                         |
  |   SkyTime is a 3D platformer in which you slow time, dodge bullets,     |
  |   destroy turrets, and overcome obstacles!                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   In SkyTime, you are a scientist who lost their family in an           |
  |   avalanche and are trying to get them back. You created a time         |
  |   machine, but it was missing one key component: a reactor core to      |
  |   power it. You stole one from the evil private military company        |
  |   Mortech, and are now being chased. Can you outrun them?               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Go through 9 levels in many different ways. You can pass through      |
  |   them as quickly as possible, or try to destroy all the turrets        |
  |   along the way. In any case, this will not be a boring evening, or     |
  |   morning, or whenever you decided to play this game!                   |
  |                                                                         |
